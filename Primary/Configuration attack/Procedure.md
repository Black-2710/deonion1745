## Comprehensive Procedure for Testing an Onion Website Using Configuration Attacks

### **1. Preparation**

#### **1.1 Set Up the Environment**
- **Install the Tor Browser**: 
  - Download from [the official Tor Project website](https://www.torproject.org/).
  - Install it following the provided instructions for your operating system.

- **Set Up a Virtual Machine (VM)**:
  - Use software like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/).
  - Install a Linux distribution (e.g., Kali Linux) that comes with many security tools pre-installed.

- **Network Configuration**:
  - Ensure your VM is configured to route traffic through the Tor network.
  - You can set up a proxy in your network settings or use the Tor service directly.

#### **1.2 Gather Tools**
- **OnionScan**: 
  - Clone the repository and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/susmithH/OniScan.git
    cd OniScan
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- **Nmap**: 
  - Install Nmap:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nmap
    ```

- **Burp Suite**: 
  - Download Burp Suite Community Edition from [PortSwigger's website](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload).

- **Nikto**: 
  - Install Nikto:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install nikto
    ```

### **2. Scanning for Vulnerabilities**

#### **2.1 Use OnionScan**
OnionScan is designed specifically for onion services and can help identify misconfigurations.

- Run OnionScan against the target onion URL:
  ```bash
  python onionscan.py <onion-url>
  ```
- Review the output for:
  - **IP Address Leaks**: Check if the service accidentally exposes its real IP address.
  - **Server Information Disclosure**: Look for version numbers and sensitive information in headers.
  - **Exposed Admin Panels**: Identify any admin interfaces that are publicly accessible.

#### **2.2 Conduct Port Scanning with Nmap**
Nmap can help identify open ports and services that may be misconfigured.

- Perform a comprehensive scan to identify open ports:
  ```bash
  nmap -sS -sV -p- <onion-url>
  ```
- Analyze the results for:
  - Unnecessary open ports (e.g., FTP, SSH).
  - Services running on those ports with version numbers that may be outdated or vulnerable.

### **3. Configuration Assessment**

#### **3.1 Review Server Configuration**
Misconfigurations in server settings can lead to serious vulnerabilities.

- If you have access to the server, check configuration files (e.g., `httpd.conf` for Apache or `nginx.conf` for Nginx). If you do not have direct access, you may need to infer configurations based on responses from the web server.

##### Example Apache Configuration Check:
```apache
# Check if server status is exposed
<Location "/server-status">
    SetHandler server-status
    Require ip <your-ip-address> # Restrict access to your IP only
</Location>
```
Ensure that sensitive endpoints like `/server-status` are not accessible publicly.

##### Example Nginx Configuration Check:
```nginx
# Restrict access to sensitive locations
location /admin {
    auth_basic "Restricted Access";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd; # Ensure this file is secured
}
```

#### **3.2 Check SSL/TLS Configuration**
SSL/TLS misconfigurations can lead to vulnerabilities such as man-in-the-middle attacks.

- Use `testssl.sh` to analyze SSL/TLS settings:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh.git
cd testssl.sh
./testssl.sh <onion-url>
```
- Review findings for:
  - Weak ciphers (e.g., RC4, DES).
  - Expired or self-signed certificates.
  
##### Example Output Analysis:
Look for lines indicating weak ciphers or protocols like SSLv3, which should be disabled.

### **4. Exploitation Testing**

#### **4.1 Attempt Access with Default Credentials**
Default credentials are often overlooked during configuration.

- Use Hydra to test common username/password combinations against login forms:
```bash
hydra -l admin -P /path/to/passwords.txt <onion-url> http-get /
```
Replace `/path/to/passwords.txt` with a path to your password list file.

##### Example Password List:
You can create a simple password list in a text file (`passwords.txt`) containing common passwords like:
```
admin
password123
letmein
12345678
```

#### **4.2 Test for Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities**
Directory traversal allows attackers to access files outside of the web root directory.

- Manually manipulate URLs or use automated tools like Burp Suite to test for directory traversal vulnerabilities:
```bash
curl "http://<onion-url>/../../etc/passwd"
```
This command attempts to retrieve the password file from the server if directory traversal is possible.

### **5. Post-Exploitation Analysis**

#### **5.1 Analyze Logs and Responses**
If you gain access, review server logs (if available) to assess what data was exposed.

- Check error logs (e.g., `/var/log/apache2/error.log`) for sensitive information that might be leaked during exploitation attempts.

#### **5.2 Conduct a Risk Assessment**
Classify vulnerabilities based on their severity (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).

##### Example Risk Assessment Table:

| Vulnerability                | Severity | Description                                  | Recommendation                       |
|------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Default Credentials           | High     | Admin panel accessible with default login   | Change credentials immediately      |
| Directory Traversal          | Critical | Sensitive files accessible                   | Implement input validation           |
| Weak SSL/TLS Configuration   | Medium   | Allows potential man-in-the-middle attacks   | Upgrade to strong ciphers           |

### **6. Reporting**

#### **6.1 Document Findings**
Create a detailed report including:

```markdown

### **7. Remediation Verification**

#### **7.1 Follow-Up Testing**
After remediation efforts are implemented, conduct follow-up tests using the same tools and methods to ensure vulnerabilities have been resolved.

### **8. Ethical Considerations**

Always ensure that you have explicit permission from the owner of the onion service before conducting any testing. Unauthorized testing can be illegal and unethical.

## Specific Configuration Attack Techniques

### Configuration Misconfigurations

Configuration attacks often exploit weaknesses in how services are set up:

1. **Localhost Exposure**: Ensure that services do not expose localhost configurations publicly.
   - Misconfiguration Example: A web server inadvertently allows access from external IPs when it should only be accessible internally.
   - Mitigation: Configure services to bind only to internal IPs.
   ```plaintext
   Listen 127.0.0.1:80 # Apache example to restrict access to localhost only.
   ```

2. **Insecure Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms.
   - Use `HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient` in your Tor configuration to restrict access.
   ```plaintext
   HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
   HiddenServicePort 80 <internal-ip>:<port>
   HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient stealth <client-auth-key>
   ```

3. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Protect against SSRF attacks by validating and sanitizing user inputs.
   - Example Code Snippet in PHP:
   ```php
   $url = filter_var($_POST['url'], FILTER_VALIDATE_URL);
   if ($url) {
       // Proceed with making requests only if valid URL
       $response = file_get_contents($url);
   } else {
       echo "Invalid URL.";
   }
   ```

4. **Error Handling**: Ensure error messages do not disclose sensitive information about the server setup.
   ```php
   ini_set('display_errors', '0'); // Disable error display in production environments.
   ```

By following this comprehensive procedure focused on configuration attacks, you can effectively assess an onion website's security posture while adhering to ethical standards and legal regulations regarding security testing. Always remember that responsible disclosure is key; report your findings constructively!
