## Configuration attacks
- Often categorized under security misconfigurations, occur when systems or applications are improperly configured, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. These vulnerabilities can arise from various sources, including default settings, unpatched software, and inadequate access controls.

## Types of Configuration Attacks
- **Default Settings Exploitation :** Many applications and devices come with default usernames and passwords. Attackers often exploit these defaults to gain unauthorized access. For instance, the Mirai botnet leveraged default credentials to compromise numerous devices, leading to significant DDoS attacks 34.
- **Unpatched Software :** Failing to apply security patches can leave systems exposed to known vulnerabilities. Attackers frequently scan for unpatched systems to exploit these weaknesses 46.
- **Directory Traversal Attacks :** Misconfigured web applications may allow attackers to navigate through directories and access sensitive files. This can lead to unauthorized data exposure or manipulation 24.
- **Insecure Cloud Configurations :** As organizations increasingly adopt cloud services, misconfigurations in cloud settings have become prevalent. These misconfigurations can expose sensitive data and create entry points for attackers
